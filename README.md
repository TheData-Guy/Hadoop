## What is Hadoop ?

Hadoop is the solution to above Big Data problems. It is the technology to store massive datasets on a cluster of cheap machines in a distributed manner. Not only this it provides Big Data analytics through distributed computing framework.

It is an open-source software developed as a project by Apache Software Foundation. Doug Cutting created Hadoop. In the year 2008 Yahoo gave Hadoop to Apache Software Foundation. Since then two versions of Hadoop has come. Version 1.0 in the year 2011 and version 2.0.6 in the year 2013. 


## Why Hadoop is Important ?

In today’s fast-paced world we hear a term – Big Data. Nowadays various companies collect data posted online. This unstructured data found on websites like Facebook, Instagram, emails etc comprise Big Data. Big Data demands a cost-effective, innovative solution to store and analyze it. Hadoop is the answer to all Big Data requirements. So, let’s explore why Hadoop is so important. 

### Managing Big Data 
- As we are living in the digital era there is a data explosion. The data is getting generated at a very high speed and high volume. So there is an increasing need to manage this Big Data. As we can see from the below chart chart that the volume of unstructured data is increasing exponentially. Therefore in order to manage this ever-increasing volume of data, we require Big Data technologies like Hadoop.

### Exponential Growth of Big Data Market 
- The Big Data Market size was valued at USD 162.6 billion in 2021 and is projected to grow 273.4 USD billion by 2026, at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 11.0% during the forecast period.

As the market for Big Data grows there will be a rising need for Big Data technologies. Hadoop forms the base of many big data technologies. The new technologies like Apache Spark and Flink work well over Hadoop. As it is an in-demand big data technology, there is a need to master Hadoop. As the requirements for Hadoop professionals are increasing, this makes it a must to learn technology.


###  Robust Hadoop Ecosystem
- Hadoop has a very robust and rich ecosystem which serves a wide variety of organizations. Organizations like web start-ups, telecom, financial and so on are needing Hadoop to answer their business needs.
