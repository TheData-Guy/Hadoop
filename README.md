## What is Hadoop ?

Hadoop is the solution to above Big Data problems. It is the technology to store massive datasets on a cluster of cheap machines in a distributed manner. Not only this it provides Big Data analytics through distributed computing framework.

It is an open-source software developed as a project by Apache Software Foundation. Doug Cutting created Hadoop. In the year 2008 Yahoo gave Hadoop to Apache Software Foundation. Since then two versions of Hadoop has come. Version 1.0 in the year 2011 and version 2.0.6 in the year 2013. 


## Why Hadoop is Important ?

In today’s fast-paced world we hear a term – Big Data. Nowadays various companies collect data posted online. This unstructured data found on websites like Facebook, Instagram, emails etc comprise Big Data. Big Data demands a cost-effective, innovative solution to store and analyze it. Hadoop is the answer to all Big Data requirements. So, let’s explore why Hadoop is so important. 

### Managing Big Data 
- As we are living in the digital era there is a data explosion. The data is getting generated at a very high speed and high volume. So there is an increasing need to manage this Big Data. As we can see from the below chart chart that the volume of unstructured data is increasing exponentially. Therefore in order to manage this ever-increasing volume of data, we require Big Data technologies like Hadoop.

### Exponential Growth of Big Data Market 
- The Big Data Market size was valued at USD 162.6 billion in 2021 and is projected to grow 273.4 USD billion by 2026, at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 11.0% during the forecast period.

As the market for Big Data grows there will be a rising need for Big Data technologies. Hadoop forms the base of many big data technologies. The new technologies like Apache Spark and Flink work well over Hadoop. As it is an in-demand big data technology, there is a need to master Hadoop. As the requirements for Hadoop professionals are increasing, this makes it a must to learn technology.


###  Robust Hadoop Ecosystem
- Hadoop has a very robust and rich ecosystem which serves a wide variety of organizations. Organizations like web start-ups, telecom, financial and so on are needing Hadoop to answer their business needs.

### Research Tool
- Hadoop has come up as a powerful research tool. It allows an organization to find answers to their business questions. Hadoop helps them in research and development work. Companies use it to perform the analysis. They use this analysis to develop a rapport with the customer.Applying Big Data techniques improve operational effectiveness and efficiencies of generating great revenue in business. It brings a better understanding of the business value and develops business growth. Communication and distribution of information between different companies are feasible via big data analytics and IT techniques. 

### Ease of Use 
- Creators of Hadoop have written it in Java, which has the biggest developer community. Therefore, it is easy to adapt by programmers. You can have the flexibility of programming in other languages too like C, C++, Python, Perl, Ruby etc. If you are familiar with SQL, it is easy to use HIVE. If you are ok with scripting then PIG is for you. 

Hadoop framework handles all the parallel processing of the data at the back-end. We need not worry about the complexities of distributed processing while coding. We just need to write the driver program, mapper and reducer function. Hadoop framework takes care of how the data gets stored and processed in a distributed manner. After Spark Processing Framework it becomes More Eaiser.

### Hadoop is Presend Everywhere
- There is no industry where Big Data has not reached. Big Data has covered almost all domains like healthcare, retail, government, banking, media, transportation, natural resources and so on.

### A Maturing Technolog 

- Hadoop is evolving with time. The new version of Hadoop i.e. Hadoop 3.0 is coming into the market. It has already collaborated with HortonWorks, Tableau, MapR, and even BI experts to name a few. New actors like Spark, Flink etc. are coming on the Big Data stage. These technologies promise the lightening speed of processing. These technologies also provide a single platform for various kinds of workloads. It is compatible with these new players. It provides robust data storage over which we can deploy technologies like Spark and Flink.

- The advent of Spark has enhanced the Hadoop ecosystem. The coming of Spark in the market has enriched the processing capability of Hadoop. Spark creators have designed it to work with Hadoop’s distributed storage system HDFS. It can also work over HBase and Amazon’s S3. Even if you work on Hadoop 1.x you can take advantage of Spark’s capabilities.

### Hadoop has a Better Career Scope 

- Hadoop excels in processing a wide variety of data. We have various components of Hadoop ecosystem providing batch processing, stream processing, machine learning, Big Data Analytics and so on. Learning it will open gates to a variety of job roles like:

 * Big Data Migration Engineer.
 * Big Data Backend Developer.
 * Database Engineer.
 * Big Data Architect.
 * Hadoop Developer
 * Cloud Data Engineer.
